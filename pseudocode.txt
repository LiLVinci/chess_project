Make a chessboard with a grid of x and y coordinates

For every piece make an object with attributes:
- Color: What color the piece belongs to 
- Movement: the possible x and y corrdinates that they can move (eg farmerr: +1y, king: +1x, -1x, +1y, -1y
- bool killed: a bool that says if they got killed or not 

On the chessboard place the specific figures on the right space. 
Make turns where specific pieces can be moved by the right player. 
Disable possible movements that end on a friendly figure. 
If a player moves a piece on a enemy figure, this figure then is beaten and goes out of the game.
